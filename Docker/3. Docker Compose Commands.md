| Command | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `docker compose up -d` | Builds (if needed) and starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yml` in detached mode. Great for launching full ML pipelines. |
| `docker compose down` | Stops and removes all containers, networks, and temporary volumes created by `up`. Keeps your system clean. |
| `docker compose ps` | Lists the containers created by Compose, including their state and ports. |
| `docker compose logs -f` | Streams logs from all Compose services â€” ideal for monitoring multiple components like API + DB simultaneously. |
| `docker compose exec <service> bash` | Executes a shell command inside a running Compose service, similar to `docker exec`. |
| `docker compose build` | Builds or rebuilds the images defined in the compose file without starting containers. Useful when dependencies or code change. |
| `docker compose config` | Validates and displays the final merged Compose configuration (including environment variable substitutions). |
