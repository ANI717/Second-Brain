- Always use **`--env-file`** for sensitive credentials instead of inline `-e` variables.  
- Combine **`--read-only`** with **`--tmpfs`** for high-security setups.  
- For debugging, use **`docker exec -it <container> /bin/sh`** or **`bash`** depending on the image.  
- Monitor all containers with **`docker stats`** during ML training jobs.  
- Use **named volumes** (not bind mounts) for persistent data when deploying across environments.  
- Regularly run **`docker system prune -a`** to prevent disk bloat from intermediate layers.
