- **FROM**: base image (can alias with `AS` for multistage).
- **ARG**: build-time only; not persisted in the final image unless exported to `ENV`.
- **ENV**: runtime env vars (persist in the image).
- **LABEL**: metadata; useful for provenance and scanners.
- **WORKDIR**: sets default dir for subsequent instructions.
- **COPY**: use `--chown` for non-root containers. Prefer COPY over ADD unless remote URLs or tar auto-extract is needed.
- **ENTRYPOINT**: for the main executable.
- **CMD**: for default flags.
- **USER**: to drop root.
- **EXPOSE**: to expose ports.
- **HEALTHCHECK**: enables orchestrators to know if the app is healthy.
- **STOPSIGNAL**: aligns with appâ€™s graceful shutdown.
- **ONBUILD**: triggers when another Dockerfile uses the image as a base.
