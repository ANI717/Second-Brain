| Command                        | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker ps`                    | Displays currently running containers with ID, image, command, uptime, and exposed ports. Helps you check active containers quickly.                     |
| `docker ps -a`                 | Lists all containers, including stopped ones, useful for diagnosing startup failures or cleanup.                                                         |
| `docker run [options] <image>` | Creates and starts a new container from an image. You can attach options like `-d` (detached), `-p` (port mapping), `-v` (volume), `--env-file`, etc.    |
| `docker logs <name>`           | Displays logs from a containerâ€™s stdout/stderr. Add `-f` to follow logs in real-time, great for debugging applications.                                  |
| `docker exec -it <name> bash`  | Opens an interactive shell inside a running container. Perfect for inspecting runtime state or debugging.                                                |
| `docker stop <name>`           | Gracefully stops a running container by sending a SIGTERM signal.                                                                                        |
| `docker start <name>`          | Restarts a previously stopped container without creating a new one.                                                                                      |
| `docker restart <name>`        | Stops and starts a container in one step. Useful for applying configuration changes.                                                                     |
| `docker rm <name>`             | Removes one or more stopped containers to free up system resources.                                                                                      |
| `docker inspect <name>`        | Shows detailed low-level information about a container, such as IP address, volumes, and environment variables.                                          |
| `docker stats`                 | Continuously displays real-time metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O) for all running containers. Ideal for monitoring resource usage during training runs. |
| `docker top <name>`            | Displays the processes currently running inside a container, similar to `top` on Linux.                                                                  |
