| `docker images`                    | Lists all locally available Docker images along with their repository name, tag, image ID, creation date, and size. Useful to verify what base or custom images you’ve built or pulled.                  |
| `docker pull <image>`              | Downloads an image from Docker Hub or another configured registry. You can specify a tag like `ubuntu:20.04` to get a specific version.                                                                  |
| `docker build -t <name>:<tag> .`   | Builds an image from a Dockerfile in the current directory. The `-t` flag assigns a name and optional version tag to the resulting image, which is very useful for version control (e.g., `mlapi:v1.0`). |
| `docker rmi <image>`               | Removes one or more local images by name or ID. Use it to clean up outdated or unused builds.                                                                                                            |
| `docker tag <source> <repo>:<tag>` | Creates a new tag for an existing image, usually before pushing to a registry. Example: `docker tag myapp:latest myrepo/myapp:v1`.                                                                       |
| `docker push <repo>:<tag>`         | Uploads an image to Docker Hub or your private registry, making it available for deployment across machines or clusters.                                                                                 |
| `docker save -o file.tar <image>`  | Exports an image as a `.tar` file — great for transferring images to environments without registry access.                                                                                               |
| `docker load -i file.tar`          | Imports an image that was previously saved with `docker save`. Useful for offline deployment.                                                                                                            |
