#### `--no-install-recommends`
- **Meaning**: Tells `apt` **not** to install “recommended” packages.
- **Why**: In Debian/Ubuntu, some packages “recommend” other optional packages. By default, `apt` would install them too, even if not strictly required.
- **Effect**: You only get the **core dependencies** needed for these tools to work — nothing extra.
- **Benefit**: Keeps Docker images and systems smaller, faster to build, and with fewer potential conflicts.

Example:
If `gcc` recommends `manpages` or `gdb`, using `--no-install-recommends` prevents those from being pulled in.
