##### Synchronous vs Asynchronous
- Blocking (Synchronous) vs Non Blocking (Asynchronous)
- Blocking Send, blocked until message is received by process or mailbox (port)
- Non Blocking Send, sends message and immediately resumes operation
- Blocking Receive, blocked until new message is available
- Non Blocking Receive, receiver retrieves a message or null when message not available

##### Buffering
- Messages resides in a temporary queue
- Zero capacity buffer, does not store anything, acts like a link
- Bounded capacity buffer, queue has finite length
- Unbounded capacity buffer, queue has infinite length
