##### I/O Device Components
1. Device Controller
2. Set of Registers
3. Local Buffer
4. Device Driver
##### I/O Operation Steps
1. Device Driver sends I/O request to the Registers
2. Device Controller reads signal and determines what action to take
3. Device Controller transfers data to/from Device from/to Local Buffer
4. Data transfer to/from Local Buffer from/to CPU
5. Once data transfer complete, device controller sends Interrupt to Device Driver
6. Device Driver returns control to OS

CPU transfers data to/from Memory if required
Interrupt is generated for every byte transfer
##### Direct Memory Access (DMA)
1. Setup buffers, pointers and counters
2. Device Controller transfer data block to/from its Local Buffer from/to Memory
3. No intervention by the CPU
4. Only one Interrupt is generated by data block
5. CPU is available to do other works
